# android_vendor_tcl_4034X

This was forked from a similar device (5010D), and changed to the correct screen size etc, however, if you think I've missed somehting/not correctly ported ot (very likely) , feel free to create a pull requst with appropiate changes

This was specifically designed for the 4034X model, with sd card, 1/2gb ram, 4gb storage, etc, to while it should work for all Alcatel Pixi 4 (4) models, it may not/ all features may not
